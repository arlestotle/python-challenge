Before beginning this challenge we were asked to create a repo with two folders, PyBanks and PyPoll. Within each of the folders we created a new file called main.py amd two folders, Resources and analysis. 

In the first part of this challenge we were tasked to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company using the budget_data.csv file. We used this data to find the total number of months in the dataset, the net profit/losses, the changes and average in profit/losses over the entire period, and the greatest increase and decrase in profits over the entire period. To start I created three empty lists to store the total months, total profit/losses, and changes of profit/losses data. Then I read in the csv file and created a forloop to fill the empty lists with the desired data. Through the help of stack overflow I found that it was possible to use an index with the maximum and minimum functions to find period with the greatest increase and decrease of profit. I created various print statement to return my findings in the terminal and created a seperate text file called financial_analysis.txt to export the analysis.

In the second part of this challenge we were tasked to create another Python script to analyze the election results of a small,rural town using the election_data.csv file. We were asked to find the total number of votes casted, a list of candidates that recieved votes, the percentage of votes recieved by each candidate, the total number of votes recieved by each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
